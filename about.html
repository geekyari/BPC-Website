        <p class="text">
            The Bulacan Polytechnic College is owned and operated by the Provincial Government of Bulacan (PGB). It is known as the sole Technical -Vocational Local College in the City of Malolos, Bulacan in providing affordable education for the people of Bulacan. At the onset of operation on June 8, 1971, the school came out from its shell as Bulacan Public Community College (BPCC). It started with 44 enrollees, with three courses initially offered in 1972: (1) the Junior Secretarial,(2) General education, and (3)Steno Typing Courses.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            The Provincial Government of Bulacan changed the name of BPCC to Bulacan Polytechnic College (BPC) on September 29, 1997, by Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolution Number 97-550, and approved its Charter to provide vocational and technical instruction as well as entrepreneurship education. It prompted the school to add new courses to its existing curriculum in 2003, including Hotel and Restaurant Services, Computer Secretarial, Computer Hardware Servicing, Dual Training System in Welding, and Call Center Management in 2007.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            It established BPC satellites to further the goal of bringing education closer to young Bulakenyos, and it rippled to different municipalities in Bulacan, namely BPC-San Miguel (2006), BPC-Obando and BPC-San Jose del Monte (2007), BPC-Bocaue (2008), BPC-Angat(2009), BPC-San Rafael (2010) and BPC-Pandi (2011).
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            The triumph brought pure joy in 2014 when BPC introduced new degree programs, the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) and the Bachelor of Science in Office Management (BSOM)
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            As part of a never-ending string of accomplishments, BPC received a remarkable blessing in 2018 when the Commission on Higher Education granted it a Certificate of Recognition as a Higher Education Institution (HEI). The approval of the College to offer new sets of Degree Courses, namely: Bachelor of Science in Accounting System (BSAIS), Bachelor of Technical- Vocational teacher Education (BTVTed), and Associate in Computer Technology (ACT) also ladderized to BSIS, was the inverse of the institution’s recognition by CHED.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            In 2018, the institution made yet another breakthrough. Students from all over Bulacan and neighboring provinces rushed to the College, particularly the marginalized but deserving ones. They received free education through the CHED program known as the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education (UniFAST) to accommodate themselves based on their desired courses.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            In 2021, as we celebrated the institution’s 50th founding anniversary, we began by restructuring administrative offices, revising job descriptions, and creating new offices to make the administration more efficient, with concerned departments having more defined sets of tasks. Several measures have been implemented to promote effective fiscal management and monitor the College’s resources and assets, ensuring public accountability and transparency.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            The team’s combined efforts paved the way as the budget allocation from the Provincial Government of Bulacan increased by 64%, from 43,265,197.63 last 2018 to 70,939,811.00 this year.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            HRS has the highest enrollment rate and consistently has the most enrollees among the ten programs, with 2,217 out of 6572 or 34% across all campuses. And the BSOM program with 1118 or 17% of the total. The current administration’s great pride is that the S.Y 2021 enrollment rate exceeds 7% from the highest recorded S.Y 2015, from 6130 last 2015 to 6572 this year. It resulted in the employability rate of the S.Y. 2019 graduates with 62% from the HRS and 88% from BSOM.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            With the consistency of the BPC Community in delivering quality education to the province’s youth, we continually adapt to the needs of the industries and community. The involvement and active participation of the service-oriented and not politically inclined student leaders are among the few assets of the institution, not to mention the consideration to the welfare of the Teachers and staff both in online and Face-to-face monitoring of classes.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            Since global events are reshaping the educational landscape worldwide, our College must adapt to remain relevant and competitive. Additional program offerings are required to meet the region’s growing demand while providing our students with the competencies needed to become active participants in the region’s increasing trend toward globalization.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            Extension services must have a tangible and immediate impact on community development. It must update our buildings, facilities, laboratories, and equipment. The research will be prioritized and in line with our research agenda.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            Links and partnerships with local and international institutions, such as the telecommunications and hospitality industries, are actively sought. The College is working with the Committee on Multimedia Affairs to provide excellent branding as an essential part of our identity. It introduces us to the entire world and provides a glimpse into the quality standards we adhere to as an institution. As a result, we redesigned our online platforms and updated our social media content.
        </p><br/>
        <p class="text">
            The ultimate goal is to provide our employees and students with the knowledge, skills, and experience to prepare for the unknown future.
